# robot-manipulator-trajectory-generation
A project for generating trajectories in operational space for a robotic manipulator. It includes motion primitives for controlling the end-effector's position and velocity, inverse kinematics models, and trajectory simulations. Designed to be generic for easy modifications for various robots and tasks.
